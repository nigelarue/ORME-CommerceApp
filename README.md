# ORME-CommerceApp
Challenge 13 is to build the back end for an e-commerce site by modifying starter code. It will have a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database.

## User Story

```md
AS A manager at an internet retail company
I WANT a back end for my e-commerce website that uses the latest technologies
SO THAT my company can compete with other e-commerce companies
```

## Usage

```md
In order to start please follow these steps:

Open the terminal command line.
Run 'npm i' to install necessary script dependencies and packages.
Source DATABASE schema in the command line by first starting MySQL after entering:
  mysql -u root -p
You can set up a password in the .env file if you so choose, but for the sake of making this app work, leave it blank.
Once MySQL is running, enter into the command line:
  source db/schema.sql
This will link and start your database.
Exit MySQL afterwards by entering: 
  exit
Next, if there are any seeds to source, you will run the following command:
  node seeds/index.js
Now you are ready to start the app.
To start the app in the command line, enter:
  node server.js
```

## Expectations

```md
GIVEN a functional Express.js API
WHEN I add my database name, MySQL username, and MySQL password to an environment variable file
THEN I am able to connect to a database using Sequelize
WHEN I enter schema and seed commands
THEN a development database is created and is seeded with test data
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Sequelize models are synced to the MySQL database
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for categories, products, or tags
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete data in my database
```
